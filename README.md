# üçé Fruit Nutrition Education Web Service

## Overview

We are developing a web service aimed at educating the general public about fruits and their nutritional benefits. Many people do not consume enough fruits daily, which can lead to vitamin deficiencies and other health issues. Our goal is to motivate individuals to incorporate more fruits into their diets by providing engaging, reliable, and accessible nutritional information.

Through our web service, users will be able to discover essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other bioactive compounds present in various fruits, along with their respective health benefits. We hope to foster a deeper appreciation for fruits and encourage healthier eating habits.
